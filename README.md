Web Monetization makes it easy for viewers to support creators through anonymous micropayments.

Viewers can sign up for a service such as [https://coil.com/](Coil) and either install their extension or use their Puma Browser (Coil is currently the only provider). Then, when viewing a supported video, payments will be made while the video is playing.

Creators can monetize their content by using a PeerTube instance with the Web Monetization plugin installed, and adding their Interledger payment pointer.
A payment pointer provides a way for funds to be deposited, and a supported wallet can be created using [https://gatehub.net/](GateHub) or [https://uphold.com](Uphold). The payment pointer is added under the "Plugin Settings" tab in the video editing interface.

Currently you cannot set an account-wide payment pointer, this will be added in an update to PeerTube as a general-purpose template system.
